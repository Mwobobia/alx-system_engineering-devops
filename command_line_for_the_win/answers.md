Hint: There are many ways to print text on the command line, one way is with the 'echo' command. Try it below and good luck!

echo "hello world"

Print the current working directory.

pwd

List names of all the files in the current directory, one file per line.

ls

Print the last 5 lines of "access.log".

cat access.log | tail -5
